Sending data via multicast allows an application to send a single packet to a large number of receivers. Unlike TCP where there is a connection to each receiver and a given message is sent to each receiver individually, multicast involves sending a single packet that is then received by every application who cares to listen for it. There are lots of other advantages too but there is one fairly severe disadvantage - multicast is not be nature a reliable protocol.

Often this doesn't matter. If you're streaming live video or audio, a few dropped packets here and there don't matter. If on the other hand you're sending data that absolutely must arrive (something you'd generally use TCP for) then you need something a little bit extra. You need reliable multicast.

There are a couple of well known solutions to this problem. The first is PGM or Pragmatic Multicast. This is one of the more advanced offerings but is fairly complex to implement. A much simpler approach with similar features is MOLDUDP64, a protocol designed by the NASDAQ for delivering price feed data. This protocol is very light weight and only adds the bare essentials necessary to get reliable data transmission.

molderl is a simple server implementation that will allow Erlang applications to send data using this protocol.

### Simple tests how-to

Start the server: `application:start(molderl).`

Create a MOLD64 stream: `molderl:create_stream(hello,"hello",{239,0,0,1},8888,{192,168,0,1},5000).`

Send a message: `molderl:send_message(hello,<<"helloworld">>).`

### Unit tests how-to

1. Compile a module with the TEST flag:

        $ erlc -DTEST -o ebin/ /src/molderl_utils.erl

    or, using rebar,

        $ rebar -DTEST compile

2. Fire up the Erlang shell

        $ erl

3. Run the eunit tests:

        > eunit:test("ebin/molderl_utils.beam").
